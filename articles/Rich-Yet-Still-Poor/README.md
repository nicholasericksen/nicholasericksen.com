# Rich Yet Still Poor

How is it possible that countries can have so much money yet still be so poor?
Railroads and other public transit can be in states of dissarry. 
Taxes can be at all time highs.
GDP at all time highs.
Yet there is not enough money to fix the raillines.

Budgets are an important part of fiscal responsibilty.
Both for the individual and for the state.
In an ideal world, what is good for the individual is good for the state and what is good for the state is good for the individual.
The purpose of goverance can never exceed the instrinic value of that which is governed.

lol i feel a rant coming on here...

Ancient societies were able to accomplish great feets of architecture for example that would be too expensive to build today.
How is this truly possible?
Ancient civilizations were able to build large monuments from the finest stones and resources, 
carving each piece of stone by hand even.
Today we have a large number of machines which can process raw materials into finished goods.
Yet we are unable to create buildings with such intricate architectures and fine materials due to cost?

## Inflation and Reality

Inflation is the rise in the cost of goods over time.
This is of course one specific type of inflation, not monetary inflation or depreciation of currencies.
Inflation is of course important when considering the core mechanism of societal functioning depend on growth economies.
That is namely that economies must continue to expand in order to have more money to pay more people and raise the standard of living, driving people out of poverty.

When economies were smaller and tribes, states, and groups of people grew in material (livestock, farming, textiles, etc) and industrial ways (machinery, economies of scale, monopoly, etc), increasing production lead to an increase in the size of an economy.  Many times this size is represented as GDP for modern nations.

As the efficiency of an economy increases the price of goods usually goes down. This phenomenom can be known as deflation. As the price of goods goes down, more people are able to afford to buy those goods.
Once the local market becomes saturated and there is minimal overall production which can become absorbed by the local market, goods are then exported farther and farther away from the source to secure every greater incomes for the supplier and the nationstate in which the supplier is located.

The effect of prices coming down in the local market can cause people to actually start to decrease there spending since why buy something today which tomorrow will be cheaper if there is no pressing need for it now?

This phenomonen is in essence creating a market of people who would rather save then spend money.
This is obviously no way to grow an economy.

For markets further away from the source, and especially those without access to the raw material or produced good in there own market are at more of a disadvantage. 
The price of an imported good will generally be more expensive (taxes aside at this point) since it had to travel a longer distance to arrive at its point of sale.
There are more middle men and women along the way who need to take a cut in order for the good to reach its end customer.
The simple supply and demand can drive prices up and keep them high since the imported good is usually scarcer then the market where it is locally produced.
This is a factor of relative economic analysis. (I just made that term up here if it doesn't already exist)

Taxes, tariffs, VAT, etc. are functions of more advanced state economic control which is maybe a bit beyond the scope of this for now but an important way to control these relationships domenstically and encourage investments to be made at home, or move them abroad.

When the local economy producing the good experiences a supply shock to its inputs, this can create inflation.
For example if a clothing store requires certain local textiles to produce its high quality goods, but when it goes out into the local market to procure them, finds that there is not enough quantity available.
This will lead to price increases or the inflation of goods.

For those who produce the raw textile this can be a good thing if they are able to increase supply and adapt to the changing environment.
They ultimately make more money from selling the same product.
Say the textile mill produces linen by processing flax plants.
If they have built up a large supply of raw linen, when the supply shock occurs, they may be well positioned to take advantage of it and sell there stockpile of linen at the now higher market price.

When local and foreign economies experience supply shortages of the same required goods this can cause inflation at a global level of course.
In short, the larger the supply deficiet, the larger the impact of inflation.

In a free market, the rising cost of goods produces a signal to market makers, investors, and producers that it is more profitiable to invest into those sectors, produce goods, and reap the rewards.
This then creates more supply of goods and eventually brings the price of the goods back down to normal.

When an asset is owned during a period of general inflation, it will usually become priced higher.
On paper this creates a great sense of additional wealth being added to the individual or business.
For example when owning a home, as inflation increases, so does the value of a home.
For the home owner this is viewed as a positive generally.
For the home buyer this can drive unaffortability. 

## Prices
The factors which determine the overall price of goods and the amount of money in the money supply is probably quite complex.
Nonetheless it is easy to state that at any given moment there is a limited number of money chasing a limited number of goods at any point in time.

In a singular economy the impact of printing money and destroying money is felt only by the state itself and has no real impact.
If banks were given more money to loan and gave this money out at a zero percent interest rate and people were able to receive as much of it as they needed, this would generally lead to people running to the bank and getting free money to go and purchase what they wanted.
This would equate to adding more money into the system without initially creating more goods.
It would then be expected that the price of goods would rise as people spent more, the supply decreased, competition over scare goods caused bidding to increase, etc.

This is in essence what governments and federal reserve banks do when they control the interest rates and money supply.
The free market signal of supply and demand is superceeded by market intervening factors which distort the natural balance of investment, trade and consumption.

Whether this is better or worse when compared to free market economies is highly debated.
But this is what happens.

In short, interest rates drive peoples appetite to spend money by borrowing money.
The more money borrowed, the more money spent in the economy.

When looking at the complexity of multi state economies, printing infinite money is in fact a problem since economies are judged relative to one another.
A country that prints money to escape governmental problems for example, without producing any real output, will end up in a situation where there currency is highly devalued and they will find it harded to trade with there peers.
This power imbalance usually haunts them for many generations.
World economies are of course highly intertwined today and not many, if any, advanced economies exist purely in isolation.

## Institutional Debt
If wages increased in proportion to inflation there would be no impact to the consumer.
A loaf of bread could cost 10 today and 1000 tomorrow.
If an average wage went from 100 a month to 10000 a month tomorrow, the average person would still only be able to afford 10 loaves of bread a month, even though they have made more money on paper.


From a debt perspective it is also interesting to observe how debt can be paid off with inflation.
If someone took out a car loan for 10000 when there wage was 100 a month, it would take them 10 months to pay off the debt (assuming they use all money earned to pay for the debt and there are no taxes, etc)
Now if there wage increased as inflation did, the eventual 10000 a month salary would allow for paying off the debt with only 1 months pay.
In this world, just defer paying off the debt until inflation + wages continues to rise.

In reality this increase in wages never follows so closely to inflation, but it does eventually creep upward.

Now for the fun part.
For institutions which carry large loads of debts and own many assets, inflation can be a tool to pay off these debts.
As inflation increases generally so does the assets values.
This increase in asset value is realized in real time and does not require waiting for the wage increase to impact the institutions ability to pay off debt.

Selling the asset at the higher price can then be used to pay off the lower amount of debt.
In this way the world turns.

## So Why No Nice Things?

Perhaps inflation has caused common goods and inputs to production to become so costly that societies are forced to create outputs of much less quality than in the past.

Or perhaps we have no time to dedicate to such manual intensive labour and the monetary reward has shifted focus to mass production instead of the fine arts.

Many interesting questions with no answers.
